                <p>I'm an aspiring web developer native to the San Francisco Bay Area. I'm currently enrolled in a full-stack bootcamp through UC Berkeley Extension. After this 12-week program, I hope to find an internship.</p>

                <p>My education is in linguistics, and for the past 7 years, I've been working as an EFL teacher. I lived and worked in Russia for 3 and a half years, traveled around Europe a bit, and just recently moved back to California.</p>
                <p>I'm excited about entering a new field, especially one with so much room for growth, continuous learning, and creativity!
                </p>
                <p>In my free time I love playing with my dog, a corgi named Gaia. Whenever I can, I go hiking (a must in California), which gives me the opportunity to practice my photography. I also love to cook, or more specifically bake!</p>
